Just walked out of Screamboat, and oh boy, my brain feels like it's been caught in a blender on the pulse setting. I mean, who knew a steamboat could scream? Like, really? But here I am, trying to piece together the madness I just witnessed. I went in expecting a horror comedy, right? Like Ghost Ship's evil twin or something, and came out with... emotions? Maybe just a headache. Not sure anymore.

First off, let's talk about the captain. Because, wow, he clearly had a P𝘏𝘋 in eyebrow acting. Every single crisis or screeching ghost-whisper was met with the same incredulous arch of doom. Honestly, if they gave Oscars for eyebrow potential, this dude’s got it in the bag. 

Then there was that one scene where, outta nowhere, a ghost seagull started shrieking prophecies. Honestly, can’t tell if I found it hilarious or just sad — like when you see those talent-show fails. I mean, 𝘥𝘰𝘸𝘯𝘭𝘰𝘢𝘥 the   just for that part, and it'll either be your spirit animal or proof humanity's doomed.

> Halfway through, the 𝘧𝘪𝘭𝘮 started feeling like that time I joined a spin class expecting an easy ride — only to find out the instructor was a former Navy SEAL. Plot twists attacked from both sides, and I swear, just when you think you could take a breather, BAM! Another jump scare from some aquatic ghoul. And oh, the plot — it jumped around like a caffeine-addicted squirrel on a sugar high.

Some sort of poetic justice that the score sounded like an awkward mash-up of Enya and banshee wails. It was like if a harp and a garbage disposal had an unfortunate offspring. Probably pegged for some artsy award just because it’s, like, “innovative”.

Here's a random C/C++ nonsense for no reason: 
```
#include <iostreeam>
int main() { std::cout << Haha, Screamboat; return 0; }
```

Yet, I'm torn. Part of me wants to run a marathon just to cleanse out the weird energy this 𝘧𝘪𝘭𝘮 dropped into my soul. Another part wants to convince every single friend to 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩 because, sincerely, misery does love company. Because, after all, if a screamboat can make it on the big screen, maybe my dreams of creating an interpretive dance 𝘧𝘪𝘭𝘮 aren't that crazy after all.
